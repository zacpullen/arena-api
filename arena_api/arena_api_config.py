# arena_api is build on the C API (ArenaC) for ArenaSDK. arena_api loads
# ArenaC binary and its dependencies automatically from ArenaSDK default
# installation directory. To load ArenaC binary from a custom location add
# the full path to ArenaC binary as a value to proper key in the dictionary.
# the dictionary name must be ``ARENAC_CUSTOM_PATHS`` and must have all of
# the following keys:
#
#   'python32_win' :
#       - used to point Python 32 on Windows to load 32 bits ArenaC binary
#       - if this key has a value of empty string, arena_api loads
#         '<Installation Dir>\\Win32Release\\ArenaC_v140.dll'
#
#   'python64_win' :
#       - used to point Python 64 on Windows to load 64 bits ArenaC binary
#       - if this key has a value of empty string, arena_api loads
#         '<Installation Dir>\\x64Release\\ArenaC_v140.dll'
#
#   'python32_lin' :
#       - used to point Python 32 on Linux to load 32 bits ArenaC binary
#       - if this key has a value of empty string, arena_api uses the pathes in
#         '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/Arena_SDK.conf' to find the ArenaC shared object.
#
#   'python64_lin' :
#       - used to point Python 64 on Linux to load 64 bits ArenaC binary
#       - if this key has a value of empty string, arena_api uses the pathes in
#         '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/Arena_SDK.conf' to find the ArenaC shared object.
#
# Note:
#  - if the library path assigned, to any of the keys, does not
#    exists a FileNotFoundError exception will rise
#  - Linux keys have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
#  - To use the installed arena, give the key a value of empty string ''
#  - if ArenaSDK is not installed in the default location ,
#    'C:\Program Files\Lucid Vision Labs\Arena SDK', by the installer , it is
#    not necessary to add the non-default installation path to the
#    custom paths.
