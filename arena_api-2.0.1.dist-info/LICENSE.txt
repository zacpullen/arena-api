End-User License Agreement for LUCID VISION(TM) SDK

IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY


THIS IS A CONTRACT.  BY INSTALLING THIS SDK YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.


This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you 
and Lucid Vision Labs, Inc. (�Lucid�), which governs your use of its SDK 
Development Kit ("SDK") that will be installed on your system.  The term 
"SDK" shall also include any upgrades, modified versions or updates of the 
SDK licensed to you by Lucid.  By selecting "Agree", you agree to be 
legally bound by the terms of this EULA.  If you do not agree to the terms 
of this EULA, Lucid is unwilling to license the SDK to you.  In such case, 
you may not use the SDK.

Terms and Conditions

1.	Ownership and Intellectual Property
    The SDK, the materials associated therewith and any copies thereof are 
    the intellectual property of and are owned by Lucid and are protected by 
    law, including without limitation the copyright laws of Canada, the United 
    States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions.  
    Except as expressly stated herein, this Agreement does not grant you any 
    intellectual property rights in the SDK, the materials associated 
    therewith and any copies thereof and all rights not expressly granted are 
    reserved by Lucid.  The structure, organization and source code of the SDK 
    are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Lucid and 
    may not be disclosed to others without the express written authorization 
    of Lucid.  You may be held legally responsible for any intellectual 
    property right infringement that is caused or encouraged by your failure 
    to abide by the terms of this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement 
    requires Lucid to provide you with the source code to the SDK.

2.	Grant of License
    Lucid grants you the following rights provided that you comply with all 
    terms and conditions of this EULA.  Lucid hereby grants you a personal, 
    nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonassignable, nonsublicenseable license 
    to install and use one (1) copy of the SDK for implementation on one 
    (1) computer subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  
    You shall use the SDK exclusively to support the Lucid hardware, 
    including the right to 
        (i) use, modify, and incorporate all or portions of the source 
        code, runtime library files, and/or documentation files that may 
        be included in the unmodified SDK into your own programs to 
        support the Lucid hardware exclusively, provided that no license is 
        granted herein under any patents that may be infringed by your 
        modifications, derivative works or by other works in which any 
        portion of the SDK may be incorporated; 
        (ii) distribute the source code in object code format only as 
        substantially modified or only as part of your user programs to 
        support the Lucid hardware exclusively; and 
        (iii) distribute the runtime library files in their original 
        form to support the Lucid hardware exclusively.  Any use of the 
        SDK outside of the conditions set forth herein is strictly 
        prohibited and will be deemed a breach of this Agreement 
        resulting in immediate termination of your License.  Lucid will 
        be entitled to all available remedies at law or in equity, 
        including immediate injunctive relief and repossession of all SDK.

3.	Restrictions
    YOU MAY NOT
    (a)	make any copies of the SDK and materials associated therewith 
        except as expressly permitted in accordance with Sections 2.1 
        and 2.2 of this EULA;
    (b)	distribute copies of the SDK and materials associated therewith 
        to others;
    (c)	remove any intellectual property right notices;
    (d)	rent, lease or sublicence the SDK to others;
    (e)	modify, adapt, translate or create derivative works of the SDK; or
    (f)	reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to
        discover the source of code of the SDK, unless such activity is 
        expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this 
        limitation, it is essential to do so in order to achieve 
        operability of the SDK with another software program, and you 
        have first requested Lucid to provide the information necessary 
        to achieve such operability and Lucid has not made such 
        information available.  Lucid has the right to impose reasonable 
        conditions and to request a reasonable fee before providing such 
        information.  Any such information supplied by Lucid and any 
        information obtained by you may only be used by you for the 
        purpose described herein and may not be disclosed to any third 
        party or used to create any software which is substantially 
        similar to the expression of the SDK.
    (g)	assign this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations 
        hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior 
        written consent of Lucid.  Lucid may assign this Agreement and its 
        rights and obligations without your consent. Subject to the 
        foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the 
        benefit of the parties to it and their respective legal 
        representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

4.	Transfer
    As the Licensee, you may physically transfer the SDK from one computer 
    to another provided the SDK is used on only one (1) computer at a time
    and the computer is owned by you.  The SDK may not be shared, 
    installed or used concurrently on different computers.

5.	Warranty
    The SDK is being delivered to you AS IS and LUCID makes no warranty as 
    to its use or performance.  LUCID AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS DO NOT AND 
    CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE 
    SDK OR DOCUMENTATION.  LUCID AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, 
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, 
    MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

6.	Limitation of Liability
    IN NO EVENT WILL LUCID OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
    DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, 
    INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, WHETHER BASED 
    ON BREACH OF CONTACT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN 
    IF A LUCID REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
    LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY.  
    LUCID� AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS DISTRIBUTORS UNDER OR IN 
    CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR 
    THE SDK, IF ANY.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO 
    THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

7.	Term
    This Agreement will become effective upon your acceptance and continues 
    until you cease to use the SDK.  However, Lucid may terminate this 
    Agreement without notice if you breach any of its provisions.

8.	Third-Party Applications (consider)
    Certain third party applications may be included with, or downloaded 
    with this SDK.  Lucid makes no representations whatsoever about any of 
    these applications. Since Lucid has no control over such applications, 
    you acknowledge and agree that Lucid is not responsible for such 
    applications. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of third 
    party applications is at your sole risk and that the entire risk of 
    unsatisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you. 
    You agree that Lucid shall not be responsible or liable, directly or 
    indirectly, for any damage or loss, including but not limited to any 
    damage to or loss of data, caused or alleged to be caused by, or in 
    connection with, use of or reliance on any such third party content, 
    products, or services available on or through any such application. 
    You acknowledge and agree that the use of any third-party application 
    is governed by such third party application provider's Terms of Use, 
    License Agreement, Privacy Policy, or other such agreement and that 
    any information or personal data you provide, whether knowingly or 
    unknowingly, to such third-party application provider, will be subject 
    to such third party application provider's privacy policy, if such a 
    policy exists. LUCID DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DISCLOSURE 
    OF INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION 
    PROVIDER. LUCID EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY REGARDING WHETHER 
    YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS CAPTURED BY ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION 
    PROVIDER OR THE USE TO WHICH SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PUT BY 
    SUCH THIRD PARTY APPLICATION PROVIDER.

9.	 Injunctive Relief
    You acknowledge that, in the event you breach any provision of this 
    Agreement, Lucid will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages.  
    Lucid shall therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction against such 
    breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon 
    request without posting bond. Lucid�s right to obtain injunctive 
    relief shall not limit its right to seek further remedies.

10.	Modification
    No modification of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in 
    writing and is signed by an authorized representative of the party 
    against whom enforcement of the modification is sought.

11.	U.S. Government End Users Restricted Rights
    This provision only applies to U.S. Government end users.  The SDK is 
    a �commercial item� as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Part 2.101, 
    consisting of �commercial computer software� and �computer software 
    documentation� as such terms are defined in 48 C.F.R. 
    Part 252.227-7014(a)(1) and 48 C.F.R. Part 252.227-7014(a)(5), and 
    used in 48 C.F.R. Part 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. Part 227.7202, as 
    applicable.  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. Part 12.212, 48 C.F.R. Part 
    252.227-7015, 48 C.F.R. Part 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, 48 C.F.R. 
    Part 52.227-19, and other relevant sections of the Code of Federal 
    Regulations, as applicable, the SDK is distributed and licensed to U.S. 
    Government end users (a) only as a commercial item, and (b) with only 
    those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the 
    terms and conditions contained herein.

12.	Governing Law and General Provisions
    This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with 
    the substantive laws in force in the Province of British Columbia, 
    Canada and you irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
    the courts of the Province of British Columbia, Canada in the event of 
    any proceeding or dispute under this Agreement.  This Agreement will 
    not be governed by the conflict of law rules of any jurisdiction or the
    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
    Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.  If any part of 
    this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the 
    validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and 
    enforceable according to its terms. You may not export or re-export the
    SDK or any copy or adaptation thereof in violation of any applicable 
    laws or regulations. The provisions of Sections 1, 3, 5 and 6 shall 
    survive the termination of this Agreement, howsoever caused, but this 
    shall not imply or create any continued right to use the SDK after 
    termination of this Agreement.  This License constitutes the entire 
    agreement between the parties with respect to the SDK and supersedes 
    all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject 
    matter.  No amendment to or modification of this License will be 
    binding unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of Lucid.
    Any translation of this License is done for local requirements and in 
    the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English 
    versions, the English version of this License shall govern.
